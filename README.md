# academic_samples
Code from projects completed in classes.

For Python samples, the simplest viewing method is to download the HTML version of the notebook.
Alternatively, the ipynb files can be viewed in Jupyter notebook.

R samples are currently being retrieved from an old (and very slow) computer.
